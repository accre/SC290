Repository for Scientific Computing 290: High-Performance Computing

- This is a Github repository for Scientific Computing 290:
High-Performance Computing, Vanderbilt University, Spring 2015.

- To view the repo online visit: https://github.com/accre/SC290

- Once you download the repo, or refresh the repo using "git pull",
I would recommend copying the files outside of the repository and 
working on copies rather than the repo directly. That way, as new 
files are added, you can simply cd into the repo parent directory, 
and type:

		setpkgs -a git
		git pull

- If you edit files inside the repo itself, "git pull" will probably
complain because it cannot resolve differences between the main repo
and your local copy. In this case, you can just "git clone" another
copy of the repo, but just be sure you do not overwrite any changes
in other older/modified versions of the repo you have already been 
working on!
